### Previous projects

#### Chilean Clinical Guidelines for the management of primary Cutaneous Melanoma
I had the privilege of participating in the elaboration of the Clinical Guidelines for the management of Cutaneous Melanoma of the Chilean Society of Dermatology. The document was published in the Revista Chilena de Dermatología in 2022.  
[[paper](https://rcderm.org/index.php/rcderm/article/view/404)]



#### The epidemiology of psoriasis in Chile
I have previously collaborated with the [Global Psoriasis Atlas](https://globalpsoriasisatlas.org/) Project to study the burden of psoriasis in Chile.  

- [Comorbidities in Chilean patients with psoriasis: a Global Healthcare Study on Psoriasis](). This research, part of the Global Psoriasis Project initiative, is the analysis of a survey done in multiple dermatological care campaigns in Chile during January 2020 to March 2020.\

- [The incidence of psoriasis in Chile. An analysis of the national Waiting List Repository]().  
  This project corresponds to my thesis at the MBI, as a collaboration with the Global Psoriasis Atlas. In this study, we examined the referrals made by general practitioners requesting evaluation for new psoriasis cases in Chile during 2016-2017.\
